## Overview

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

This project was done using basic knowledge of HTML and CSS after completing the Foundations Course from The Odin Project. First project done of my own accord.

### What I learned

Through this project I was able to apply what basic HTML and CSS knowledge that I have learnt to action, and build this qr-code component from scratch!

### Continued development

After this project, I feel it is important for me to start learning CSS frameworks. The first one that I will be focusing on is Tailwind CSS and after gaining proficiency in this framework I hope to be able to build better styled websites.

I would also like to learn more about JS Libraries and Frameworks, which I am not yet fluent in.
